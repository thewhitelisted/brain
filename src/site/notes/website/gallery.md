i like to take really bad photos so bear with me. these are some of the ones that aren't terrible and i like them. ill also give a bit of background info. fyi the order is not based on date, i just pasted in a bunch from my camera roll randomly.

fig. 1: cool steak dinner. i think this was with my sister for her birthday at this fancy place she likes. i don't really enjoy fancy places for food, but this was a cool treat.

fig. 2: hung out at my cousin's place in ny. had this cool stack of books on this old staircase and it had a cool vibe. composition is way off though.

fig. 3: no clue how that one tulip is so dark but i really like it. i had a friend who really liked tulips so it made me think of them. we don't talk anymore but they're the reason why i think flowers are pretty.

fig. 4: i really liked the lighting in this photo. this was in ny after i saw wicked with my immediate family and my uncle's family. sick lighting, bad composition, cool photo.

fig. 5: i have no clue where this was. my mom had a craft show i was helping her at and once i finished with that i walked around and found this cool building. colours are the real highlight here for me.

fig. 6: shoutout to my friend nathan for being my model here. first day at his cottage during the summer and we were just chilling. the guns in the background are not real fyi

fig. 7: another cottage photo. sunset was about to happen and i really should've waited but i still really like the way it looks. heavy on the blues but you can see a tint of warmth in the sky. if you know that baby keem album cover you can see the vision i had.

fig. 8: same neighbourhood as the last flower photo. again with the tulips. lots of stuff going on, especially with that wacky toilet in the background. i feel like it was too unintentionally weird for me not to take a photo of it.

fig. 9: again with the flowers. i think i started to really like looking at them. the dead ones in this photo kinda make it perfect in an imperfect sense. composition doesn't exist in this one but i still like it.

fig. 10: this one was kinda funny for a bunch of reasons. why does that kind of sign exist? why would it be in the middle of the road? but honestly at the time i took the photo it was analogous to how i was feeling.

fig. 11: okay so sunflowers are definitely the best flowers. idc what anyone says, it's just true. every time i see a bunch of cool sunflowers i have to take a photo and stare at them for a bit.

fig. 12: this was at some park in scarborough i think. swans might be the best models.

fig. 13: another ny pic from when i was with my cousin. this one was in soho iirc. cool paintings, okay composition, awesome day.

fig. 14: i think this is when i realized i was a city boy at heart. that seems really corny but honestly, look at that view. i kinda realized that no matter how many times you go to ny, you'll never get that experience of truly living in ny. the vibe is different, but better. i hope i can end up here at some point in my life. but who knows? if there's one thing i know about myself it's that i like to dream way too big.

fig. 15: in my cousin's shared house. such a cool vibe with all the photos and the surfboards. i really got that community vibe from the kind of stuff they had around the house. got inspo for when i'm renting with friends in uni.
