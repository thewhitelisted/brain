im bad at writing but im interested at learning. so what im hoping is that if i write a lot about what im learning, i can learn and get better at writing at the same time! some of the stuff here is just opinions, others are resources that i used, and sometimes i include information about my daily life.

i use a mini-essay type system with my notes with a little bit of zettelkasten as well. this guy made a cool video about it and i used it to start this whole project. you can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4YjXJVzoZY)
