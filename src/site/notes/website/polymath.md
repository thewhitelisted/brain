i've started to develop a love for learning that i hope continues to grow in the future. i also want to extend it beyond just math and business, which would increase my versatility as a human being. currently i try to read/listen/watch content centering around various interesting subject matters such as neuroscience, productivity, and philosophy. 

i started to implement a time allotment system that i found from a [jvscholz video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkhivPQ8sbo) and you can see more about how i use it [[zettelkasten/my time allotment\|here]]
