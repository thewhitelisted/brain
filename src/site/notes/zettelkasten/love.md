# love

what does it mean to love somebody? we throw around the word and the concept so much it seems like we'd know what we were talking about. i don't know about you but i have no clue what it is but i do have thoughts on what it might be. as a religious person i grow up listening to priests talk about God's everlasting and eternal love for each and every one of us. it was such a hard concept to grasp. to think that God would love me, a sinner, who is imperfect in just about every way. i just couldn't grasp that conceptually. 

and yet, that may be what love is all about. when we love, we ignore all of the imperfections that the person we love have. in fact, arguably it is the case that we see those aspects of the person as what makes them so perfect. the unique way they laugh and smile, the quirky things that only they seem to do. what might seem to be an imperfection to others is just what makes that person seem so damn special to you. perhaps that's how God feels about everyone. seeing each and every person as equally uniquely perfect, with each and every imperfection being unequivocally perfect in His eyes.

not only is it the case that we love by seeing these imperfections as perfect, but also that we allow others to see into our own imperfections. to allow yourself to be loved, you must allow all parts of yourself to be seen. every insecurity and weak-point presented to the one who loves you, hoping that they are willing to, despite all imperfections, see you as perfect. to present yourself with not only your perfections but also your imperfections would be an invitation for others to truly admire you fully. the vulnerable self, an invitation to know and understand you down to the soul.

a precursor to love itself is to be able to be loved. it would be impossible to truly present yourself for who you are if you are unable to come to terms who your true self. therefore love begins with being able to come to terms with your own imperfections, and to see them as perfect. to begin to love others and more importantly, to accept the love of others, you must begin to accept the love of yourself. it is only after this, that you may begin to more easily present yourself to others. 

thus, loving is easy, but being loved is hard. being subject to love is arguably harder, and requires a state of absolute trust and vulnerability. it is only once you are able to love and know yourself, that you may make it easier to love others but most importantly, to be loved.
