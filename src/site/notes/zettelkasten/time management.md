# time management

time management generally tends to be a big problem with students. there's simply not enough time to comfortably finish all of your tasks without a proper structure. however, there is a way that we can confidently manage time.

the first thing you are going to want to do is start using a calendar. it's a pretty easy thing to set up, and can improve your ability to manage time by keeping track of tasks and events externally instead of in your head.

blocking out your sleep time, morning/evening routine, and classes, you should see all of your available time. from here you can block out times to study certain subjects.

it really helps if you have a consistent sleep schedule, as this will lower variability and increase usability of your calendar.

another interesting method i saw recently in a reddit post optimizes productivity and time allocation around mood, you can see the post [[zettelkasten/I stopped trying to manage my time â€” and became insanely productive. Here's how\|here]]. i would honestly recommend you use this if your life is too chaotic to efficiently manage tasks with a calendar. 

this method can also be good even if you use a calendar. if you start feeling unproductive, reallocate your time according to how you feel. this can make sure you are managing your time externally, while also taking into account how you feel internally.
