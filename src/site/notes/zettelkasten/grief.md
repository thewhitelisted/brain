i think im taking this from various different people who said it but i really agree with the concept so i don't care.

the feeling of grief and sadness that comes from losing someone you love is the best part of loving someone. the sadness and depression you feel when you have lost is the best proof that you have loved. when you grieve, grieve fully, as the true loss is when you eventually forget them. 

cry about them every night, and feel sad without them. hold no anger or resentment towards them or ruin the memories. don't delete the photos, don't get rid of the gifts, and most importantly, don't forget how happy and joyful they made life.

i would hate to lose someone i thought i loved and feel nothing.
