# subprime attention crisis

## the plumbing
* the ever-expanding reach of advertising is responsible for the "widespread sense of attentional crisis" produced by the modern technological environment.
	* disinformation, profiling, and inflammatory content
	* advertisements serve as the income for online platforms including search engines. they're more likely to be biased towards advertisers rather than consumers
* advertisements are a market for attention
	* this is an interesting way that he frames advertisements. almost as if the companies bid for the chance to be seen by consumers. 
	* analogous to social environments
	* by seeing an advertisement, your attention, even for a second, has been bought by the company who bought the ad.
	* thus, the digital becomes a hypermarket by which our attention can be bought and sold to entities
	* in a sense, platforms such as google and youtube become digital hypermarkets where the currency is your time
* the economics of attention
	* players are those willing to sell, and those willing to buy
	* eg. online advertising
		* sellers are the "publishers"
		* they have other people's attention readily available to sell. eg. influencers
		* they sell the opportunity for the buyer to display its message to the watchers
		* buyers can be large companies, agencies, or specialized companies
* infrastructure of attention
	* publishers are able to sell their inventory of attention to the highest bidder among buyers
	* done through real time bidding (RTB)
	* RTB can be initiated through clicking a link, or loading content. as soon as the opportunity to sell appears, buyers have the opportunity to bid for a spot
	* ads work through this system. all the ads that you see are determined through real-time.
	* this entire system is done through software platforms that automate the entire bidding process. this is called demand-side platforms (DSP) or supply-side platforms (SSP).
		* DSPs service the buyers
			* tools to specify parameters around the bid
			* specifying the target audience
		* SSPs service the suppliers
			* suite of tools that are a mirror image of DSP for publishers
				* gives them the ability to specify auction rules
				* allows for price floors
				* control the kinds of advertisers able to gain access to inventory
	* once configured, programmatic advertising relies on algorithm interactions to make choices of bids on advertising inventory
* failure of the infrastructure would cause significant negative impact on the internet. companies would have to change their models to most likely be paid services

## market convergence
* there is nothing essential about the internet as we know it. the internet is not inherently open or democratizing, nor is it inherently closed or authoritarian. 
* the internet has been actively designed in each stage of its history
* a compounding set of choices resulted in the experience we have today. 
* why does the advertising market resemble the financial market?
* early day advertising was nothing like the way it is today. it had a sponsor model for advertisements. 
* search engines changed the model.
	* they had a lot of members who relied on them to find things for them. they didn't have a way to make reliable money
	* early on people didn't anticipate how much advertising would make them.
		* licensing of search technology
		* hardware product that would allow companies to search their own operations very quickly (Google quick search box)
	* however, advertising made way more money
	* to do advertising, automation was required.
		* adwords: enabled advertisers to place promoted listings alongside search results
		* advertising auctions: bidding against each other for advertising spots on search results
		* algorithm that assessed the quality of ads by looking at various elements, predicting whether users were likely to click on it. drives the value of the bids in auction
	* system was intended to align incentives such that advertisers would create ads that were relevant and useful
	* all of this was made possible by software engineers and economists
	* began to create catagorizations that align with the stock market. words like high-cap, mid-cap, low-cap to generate their own versions of the Dow Jones Industrial Average
	* trading systems began to be created, and software for those systems as well
* influence of finance onto the business model of the internet
	* commercialization of the internet
	* needed to become financially sustainable, so they went to bundling user attention online and selling it
	* distinguishing commercialization of the internet from normal commercialization
		* earlier generations of advertisers bought and sold attention, but not at the speed, scale, characteristics of today's market
		* what is different is the extent to which the system has enabled the bundling of a multitude of tiny moments of attention into discrete, liquid assets that can be bought and sold effortlessly.
* steps to commodification
	* standardization
		* allows the market to accommodate a larger number of players. 
		* buyers cannot easily assess what they're buying. this makes it easier.
		* by creating standards, everyone knows what they're getting. increases the buyers and sellers
	* abstraction
		* standards are disconnected from the process of production and unique identity of producers
		* nobody needs to know specific characteristics anymore
		* everything is interchangeable.
		* enables arrangements that might never otherwise emerge
		* facilitates speculation
			* groups with little interest in production or consumption might choose to engage in buying and selling to make money from fluctuations in price
* commodification of our attention
	* the maturation of the online marketplace for attention closely mirrors the development of real markets
	* the emergence of online platforms resulted in a standardization for attention markets. (ad impression measurement guidelines)
	* breaking down attention into discrete units and exchanging them in the marketplace
	* standard definitions get created as well. "delivered" referring to when a webpage loads. turns into successfully delivered only of the user actually pauses and looks at it
	* specific standards such as "viewable impression" which only occurs when more than 50% of the pixels in an advertisement occupy the viewable space of a browser page for more than or equal to one continuous second after the advertising renders.
	* the commodification creates a fluid marketplace where everything is discrete, comparable pieces.
	* attention is now abstract. it is now possible to purchase attention without knowing where and how that attention is produced
	* capturing desired attention at minimal cost
	* gives rise to a set of incentives that can cause such marketplaces to inherit some of the pathologies observed in financial markets if under the right conditions
* relations between financial market crashes and the current attention market
* differences between financial markets and attention markets
	* bidding over the right to show something to someone vs bought and sold
	* consumed at the point it is acquired vs being able to hold inventory
	* value based on whether it shapes behavior vs financial factors
* the mechanism of a market crash do not depend on these differences
* opaque markets
	* allow expectations about a market to diverge from reality
	* things can get worse without people knowing
	* allows things to change in secret
	* can cause errors in valuation, inflation, and irrational levels of market confidence

## Opacity
* Does advertising work?
	* how does one know that the advertising messages being broadcast actually influence people
	* there's no simple way of knowing the role of advertising in physical forms such as billboards
	* online ads are traceable, trackable, and thoroughly quantified
	* selling point for digital advertising
* advertisements can be specifically targeted to certain audiences
* we can measure all of the metrics of success for an ad, and it allows advertisers to accomplish feats of marketing that would have been prohibitively expensive or otherwise impossible in a pre-internet era
* overall, the market stays opaque
	* wealth of tracking data doesn't help advertisers determine a fair going price for reaching certain types of people
* opacity permits market bubbles to form
* modern online advertising remains deeply opaque on three froms
	* automation of marketplace
	* creation of dark pools of liquidity where advertising inventory is bought and sold outside public eye
	* dominance of platforms like facebook and google, with new layers of opacity
* algorithmic trading
	* ad exchanges reach the speed they do through automation
	* advertisers and publishers program systems that automatically offer and price ad inventory in the marketplace
	* they can set minimum prices, rules, and other preferences
	* allows online advertising exchanges to deliver large quantities of inventory day and night
	* brand safety issues due to opacity remain a large problem for automation.
	* challenging to know where an ad ends up and why
* dark pools
	* not knowing where or why ads end up where they do is bad
	* dark pools are markets where no public info is available
	* create abusable opacity
	* insider trading and market
	* changes potential value of an ad without people knowing
* new intermediaries
	* middleman role
	* disintermediation is good, but now the companies such as google and facebook have become the new intermediaries
	* increases opacity because the market is now dependent on a small number of platforms
	* lack of transparency with company and public
* why opacity matters
	* why should we care?
	* it's a key precondition for market failure
	* participants of the market cannot accurately assess the value of things being exchanged
	* obscuring things for the participants leads to overinflation/underinflation.
	* determines the futures of these markets
