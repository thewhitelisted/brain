# subprime attention crisis

* the ever-expanding reach of advertising is responsible for the "widespread sense of attentional crisis" produced by the modern technological environment.
	* disinformation, profiling, and inflammatory content
	* advertisements serve as the income for online platforms including search engines. they're more likely to be biased towards advertisers rather than consumers
* advertisements are a market for attention
	* this is an interesting way that he frames advertisements. almost as if the companies bid for the chance to be seen by consumers. 
	* analogous to social environments
	* by seeing an advertisement, your attention, even for a second, has been bought by the company who bought the ad.
	* thus, the digital becomes a hypermarket by which our attention can be bought and sold to entities
	* in a sense, platforms such as google and youtube become digital hypermarkets where the currency is your time
* the economics of attention
	* players are those willing to sell, and those willing to buy
	* eg. online advertising
		* sellers are the "publishers"
		* they have other people's attention readily available to sell. eg. influencers
		* they sell the opportunity for the buyer to display its message to the watchers
		* buyers can be large companies, agencies, or specialized companies
* infrastructure of attention
	* publishers are able to sell their inventory of attention to the highest bidder among buyers
	* done through real time bidding (RTB)
	* RTB can be initiated through clicking a link, or loading content. as soon as the opportunity to sell appears, buyers have the opportunity to bid for a spot
	* ads work through this system. all the ads that you see are determined through real-time.
	* this entire system is done through software platforms that automate the entire bidding process. this is called demand-side platforms (DSP) or supply-side platforms (SSP).
		* DSPs service the buyers
			* tools to specify parameters around the bid
			* specifying the target audience
		* SSPs service the suppliers
			* suite of tools that are a mirror image of DSP for publishers
				* gives them the ability to specify auction rules
				* allows for price floors
				* control the kinds of advertisers able to gain access to inventory
	* once configured, programmatic advertising relies on algorithm interactions to make choices of bids on advertising inventory
* failure of the infrastructure would cause significant negative impact on the internet. companies would have to change their models to most likely be paid services
