# maxims

these are some thoughts i have about life and the world and philosophy. you'll see some stoic/baudrillardian themes in some of the lines. i try to use my original thoughts sometimes but i'm sure some philosopher in 568bc came up with it before me haha.

i find myself knowing others better than i know myself. to know myself would be tragic. i would hate to be others.

in a cage in a cart dragged by a donkey.  i must not enjoy it, otherwise the cage might seem bigger than it is

i see men who dig themselves into a hole and blame the person who gave them the shovel

the social is a self-propelling machine of detachment from reality. yet, we can't live without it

hedonism. as if it is the only option to deal with the consistency of inconsistency.

grief is proof that you have loved. do not forget those you have loved. love with all your heart.
