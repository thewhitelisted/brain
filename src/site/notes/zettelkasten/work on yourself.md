# work on yourself

you are your own greatest asset.

as abraham lincoln said: "if i had eight hours to chop down a tree, i'd spend the first six hours sharpening my axe." this quote shows the value of preparation, but is also analogous to life itself. if i had a goal i wanted to achieve in life, i would spend the first 20 years working on developing myself to the highest order.

the goal may not be evident, but remember that it will reveal itself to you. you don't want to start preparing once you know the task at hand. and thus suppose i had to cut down a tree in eight hours. i would spend the first six hours sharpening my axe, and the previous 7 years building my physical strength. work on yourself, and be proud of what you can accomplish once you need to.
