# my time allotment

so i use james scholz's system, which is basically thinking of your time as 100 soldiers that you can allot to different tasks. realistically speaking you can only fight up to 3 battles effectively. therefore you must delegate those soldiers such that the three most important parts of your life have the most soldiers

heres how i use it (as of 30 nov 24)
1. school - 50: school is a big part of my life right now mainly because i want to learn the technical skills required for my field.
2. career - 20: i really want to try to see how competitive i can be in my chosen field. im alloting a lot of time into research, developing technical skills, and road mapping my potential career path
3. self-learning - 20: this is slowly becoming a bigger part of my life. i also have to pick and delegate these soldiers to what specific field im learning about. right now i think im going to put a big focus on philosophy and the neuroscience (more specifically how external factors influence productivity, memory, learning, etc.)
4. health - 10: health is a pretty vital part of my life. if im not feeling good then i can't ensure the other parts of my life are being effectively pursued. i prioritize a lot of my time into making sure im well hydrated, fed, and rested. this also includes weight training, sports, and cardio
