# how to get good sleep

getting good sleep is all about consistency. our goal is to develop a routine of habits that will allow our bodies to be ready for sleep when we need it to be, and ready to be productive when we wake up. the way we do both of these is by developing a system that allows us to get a healthy amount of sleep every day.

the first thing you want to figure out is your sleep need. this is kind of complicated if you're behind on sleep. but if you aren't then just go to bed at your usual time, and track how long you're asleep before you wake up naturally. if you're behind on sleep, then just assume a time of 7 hours.

once you figure that out, then figure out when you want to wake up. this is a pretty simple task because you can just pick a time early enough to ensure that you won't have to wake up any earlier in any case. for me, this is 6:30am. make sure you leave plenty of time between waking up and your first task, as this will ensure a good buffer period that reduces potential stress.

after doing that then all you have to do is establish your bedtime, which is just the difference of your wakeup time and your sleep need. now with all the basics covered, its time to actually develop the routine.

## morning

the morning routine is pretty simple, and requires very little changes in lifestyle. all you have to do is wake up at your desired wakeup time. this is obviously easier said than done in the first stages of developing this schedule, but it must be done. force yourself out of bed as soon as you wake up, and go get bright light. this sets your circadian rhythm up for the day, and will help you in adjusting to your new habits. 

i would suggest drinking around 8oz of water every two hours after you wake up for the first 10 hours of your day. this ensures baseline hydration, and is important for the evening routine. this is also the time to take any supplements that you take in the morning. 

avoid caffeine for the first 90 minutes of being awake, there's a bunch of sciency reasons for this but just trust me, you won't feel the crash as much. also avoid caffeine 10 hours before you go to bed, which should be a no-brainer. there's some trace amounts of caffeine in some soft drinks, but for some this is not high enough to actually affect them. 

also, avoid carb-heavy breakfasts, which often have an effect of making you feel lethargic or tired after. I often will just skip breakfast, but if you really don't want to then eat some healthy fruits or get some protein.

i would also recommend that you try to get moving shortly after waking up, this can make you less groggy.

finally, get some work done. a really cool effect of sleeping a lot is that when you wake up you feel really productive. take advantage of this and get some work done.

## evening

the evening routine actually starts around 3 hours before you sleep. this is the cutoff for both food and drinks. this is why it's vital that you get in your water early in the day. eating food close to your sleep time can negatively affect the quality of sleep, and drinking water close to bedtime can make you want to pee in the night. by doing this, you ensure that you get high quality, uninterrupted sleep. this is probably one of the hardest parts of the schedule, and takes a lot of time to get used to.

the next cutoff is 2 hours before you sleep. 2 hours before you sleep you should stop doing work. from this point on, any tasks that you do should be getting ready for bed, journaling, or something you enjoy doing. this is also the time to dim the lights and be in a darker environment.

the final cutoff is 1 hour before you sleep. after this point, you should be taking any nighttime supplements you may have (ie melatonin or magnesium), and turning off your phone for the final time of the night. the blue light from your phone can negatively affect your ability to fall asleep, however some are unaffected by this. i would avoid taking melatonin because it could suppress hormone secretion. however, if you want to quickly adjust to the schedule, this is the way to do it.

and now, around 15-30 minutes before you sleep, you should probably get in bed. you want a small buffer window to allow you to fall asleep.
