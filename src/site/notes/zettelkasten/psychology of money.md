# psychology of money

## introduction: the greatest show on earth
* the premise of the book is that doing well with money has little to do with how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave
* behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people
* knowing what to do tells you nothing about what happens in your head when you try to do it

## 1. no one's crazy
* people do some crazy things with money, but nobody is crazy
* people are raised differently, and learn different lessons
* everyone has their own unique experiences of how the world works
* your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what's happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works. 
* no amount of studying or open-mindedness can genuinely create the same fear and uncertainty of a depression
* in theory people should make investment decisions based on their goals and the characteristics of the investment options available to them at the time
* it's just what environment you were born in
* "what you're doing seems crazy but i kind of understand why you're doing it"

## 2. luck and risk
* luck and risk are siblings
* both the reality of every outcome in life. everything is guided by forces other than individual effort
* "nothing is as good or bad as it seems"
* luck and risk are so similar that you can't believe in one without equally respecting the other
* everything worth pursuing has less than 100% odds of succeeding, and risk is just what happens when you end up on the unfortunate side of that equation
* "the line between inspiringly bold and foolishly reckless can be a millimeter thick and only visible with hindsight"
* BE CAREFUL WHO YOU PRAISE AND ADMIRE
* BE CAREFUL WHO YOU LOOK DOWN UPON AND WISH TO AVOID BECOMING
* FOCUS LESS ON SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS AND CASE STUDIES AND MORE ON BROAD PATTERNS

## 3. never enough
* for a critical element of our society, including many of the wealthiest and most powerful among us, there seems to be no limit today on what enough entails
* "there is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don't have and don't need"
* THE HARDEST FINANCIAL SKILL IS GETTING THE GOALPOST TO STOP MOVING
* if expectations rise with results there is no logic in striving for more because you'll feel the same after putting in extra effort.
* life isn't any fun without a sense of enough
* SOCIAL COMPARISON IS THE PROBLEM
* the ceiling of social comparison is so high that virtually no one will ever hit it. battle that will never be won
* ENOUGH IS NOT TOO LITTLE
* the idea of having "enough" might look like conservatism, leaving opportunity and potential on the table
* "enough" is the opposite. an insatiable appetite for more will push you to the point of regret
* THERE ARE MANY THINGS NEVER WORTH RISKING, NO MATTER THE POTENTIAL GAIN
* don't get too attached to anything
* reputation is invaluable, freedom and independence are invaluable, family and friends are invaluable, being loved by those who you want to love you is invaluable, happiness is invaluable.
* the best shot of keeping those things is by knowing when it's time to stop taking risks

## 4. confounding compounding
