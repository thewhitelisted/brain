# I stopped trying to manage my time — and became insanely productive. Here's how

NOTE: this is a paste from the following reddit link: [I stopped trying to manage my time — and became insanely productive. Here's how](https://old.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1h07n68/i_stopped_trying_to_manage_my_time_and_became/)

This may seem a strange suggestion. Please bear with me. I found, when I made this switch, I could easily fit a day’s worth of work into a couple of hours. How? Here's the epiphany:

I had to **match my task** to my **mood**. Yes. Instead of spending all those years trying to manage my _time_, I should've managed my _mood_ instead.

Let me explain.

Our moods can be categorized into four basic states— a combination of high energy/low energy. Feeling positive/ feeling negative. Let's break it down.

1. **High energy + feeling positive:** You’re **happy**. This upbeat, energized state is great for routine tasks, or creating content. However, you might be too excited for serious creative problem-solving.
2. **High energy + feeling negative:** You’re **stressed**. Restless. This is probably the worst state for creative problem-solving. _(There's a solution we'll discuss shortly.)_
3. **Low energy + feeling negative:** You’re feeling **depressed** and hopeless. It's hard to do anything productive. This is clearly a state to avoid.
4. **Low energy + feeling positive:** You're **relaxed**, optimistic, and you feel good. My favorite state. This is when creative ideas are most likely to emerge. You're able to tackle your biggest, scariest tasks.

Key Point: Recognize your mood, and then pick a task to match.

**One caveat**: you almost always have a lot of tasks to do, and you _cannot_ always depend on your 'mood.' That way you'd get _nothing_ done. There's an interesting solution to this: you can pick tasks to **change your mood**.

.

Do you check your phone first thing in the morning? I did too—and it's a BIG mistake. You see, the morning is likely your most creative time of day. You are **relaxed**, and you probably feel positive. This is quite literally the best state to get stuff done.

But when you check your phone, it drags you _away_ from the relaxed state. It always **raises your energy**. And if you see something unpleasant (an angry email, bad news et al.), it throws you into a negative state as well.

You go from **relaxed -> high energy**, and from **positive -> negative**. In short, you become **stressed**— which isn't a nice place to get work done.

Key Point: Avoid tasks which put you in unfavorable moods.

.

Let's say you do your best work in the **relaxed** state. However, by around noon, your energy levels have picked up. You also have to do tasks you hate, which often make you feel negative. This has sent you into the **stressed** state.

To offset this stress, you can engage in physical activity—exercise, walking, running, swimming, weightlifting, or whatever is an option. This will lower your energy, and make you feel good.

Key Point: Pick tasks which put you in favorable moods.

.

Here’s what you can do depending on each mood:

1. **Happy:** Tackle administrative tasks, create content, or brainstorm ideas for problems you're trying to solve.
2. **Stressed:** Go for a run. Hit the gym. Engage in any kind of physical activity—it can help reduce stress.
3. **Depressed:** If possible, step away from work and engage in activities like watching a movie or taking a walk. Getting outside is a huge help. If you must work, choose tasks that don't require a high level of creativity or emotional energy, such as administrative work or research. If you must do creative tasks, begin with a small, achievable goal like writing a page or two.
4. **Relaxed:** Take advantage of this state. Don’t waste it. Stay away from emails and social media. This is the mood which saves you the most time. Solve your most challenging and daunting tasks head-on. The ones you've been putting off.

That's all. What do you think? Will you give this a try?
