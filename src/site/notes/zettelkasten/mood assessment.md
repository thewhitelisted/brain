# mood assessment

i just thought about how i don't really assess my mood. this got triggered by this system i found on a reddit post titled: "[[zettelkasten/I stopped trying to manage my time — and became insanely productive. Here's how\|I stopped trying to manage my time — and became insanely productive. Here's how]]" and it made me reflect on how I spend my time based on mood. 

from what he talks about, i usually spend my time in a state of relaxation or stress (or from what i can tell at least). but i never really take time to assess my mood and actually figure out how that affects my productivity. its actually a pretty smart system that he implements because he can get the most done based on how he's feeling.

not only that, i can use this approach to become more mindful and philosophical about the way i approach every day. i want to get into the habit of, everyday, assessing how i feel, and how that will impact my productivity. i think by doing so consistently, not only can i optimize efficiency in my study system, but also become more mindful and intentional with myself.
