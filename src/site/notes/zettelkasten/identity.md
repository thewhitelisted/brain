# identity

this is the big one. this is the part that you'll most likely be thinking about for a while. what is your "why"? why are you doing this? what is the point? you can chase grades all you want but if you don't have an actual motivating factor, then what's the point? 

find your passion, find your "why", find out why you want to get good grades, and use that to motivate yourself. use the person you want to be to influence the person you are. ask yourself: "is this what my ideal self would do?" 

have a growth mindset, and never tell yourself you're not good at anything. i hate when people say: "i'm just not good at math" because it's stupid. of course you're bad at math if you keep saying it. and if you just accept that you're bad at math, you aren't going to strive to be better at it, because well, you're just not good at math.
