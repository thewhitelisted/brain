# effective studying

lets talk about effective studying. grades are a product of the effectiveness of the study system. if you're studying for 12 hours a day and still getting only 70s and 80s, then it's time to assess your methods and figure out what's not working. some of the methods that really tend to work include:

- pomodoro: mainly a tool that helps you avoid burnout while maximizing the amount of effective study time.
- flashcards: great for memorizing
- practice questions: great for learning how to solve problems relating to content
- blurting: great for memorizing, and assessing what you know/need to memorize
- feynman technique: great for understanding content

each of these techniques are cool, and they work. i mentioned the idea of effective study time, which i believe is a more accurate metric of how much you're actually studying. take our example person from the beginning who studies 12 hours a day. they probably only actually spend time working for 8 of those hours due to distractions, and after hour 5 they begin to study at around 50% effectiveness due to fatigue. we can calculate their effective study time by doing the following calculation:

$$
effective{\space}study{\space}time={\sum}time_i{\times}effetiveness_i
$$

which for our example, basically translates to:

$$
effective{\space}study{\space}time=(5{\times}100{\%})+(3{\times}50{\%})
$$
$$
effective{\space}study{\space}time=6.5{\space}hours
$$

therefore, the effective time spent studying is 6.5 hours. this brings me to my next point, which is sleeping. 

sleep is an essential requirement for good physical and mental health. it's also an essential requirement for effective knowledge retention, which is essential for studying and learning in general. it is critical that you get (at the minimum) 7-9 hours of sleep. it seems counter-intuitive to suggest this, but an extra hour of sleep is generally speaking more useful than an extra hour of studying. consider our effective study time formula. we get the maximum value from studying as long as our effectiveness stays at 100%. we can minimize effectiveness loss from fatigue by using good timing techniques like pomodoro, but we will always, unavoidably lose effectiveness from both tiredness and both short and long term sleep deprivation. the solution? sleep. you can read [[zettelkasten/how to get good sleep\|how to get good sleep]] here and develop a good sleep schedule.

combining both a good study system and a good sleep schedule will allow you to maximize the effectiveness of your time, and improve the likelihood of desirable results.
