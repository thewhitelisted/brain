# how to be good at school

the first notable fact is that being good at school is not a matter of marks. chasing marks is never good and often leads to an unfavorable result, whether that is not achieving desirable results or not following through on habitual goals. in order to get better marks, we have to achieve the goal of becoming a good student first. if we become good students, then the good marks will come eventually. 

but what makes a good student? in my eyes there are a few main factors that differentiate a good student from a bad student.

## effective studying

most of the people who i meet who struggle with achieving desirable marks tend to say the following. "i can't get good marks!! i study for like 12 hours a day and pull all-nighters but i still get 70s!!" there's a lot wrong with this, and i'll explain why. first and foremost, the person is probably overexaggerating the amount of time they spend studying. even if they do study for that long, they may not be studying in an effective manner. finally, the biggest red flag is the fact that they do not prioritize sleep. i'll talk about what i would recommend in order to optimize effective studying in this document.

## time management

time management is a big factor for success in school. having the ability to allocate time to tasks effectively makes the entire process of studying, learning, and creating much easier. this also translates to your life outside of school, and can allow you to make the most out of your day.

## identity

this is the most important part, and it can greatly influence the first two. you have to be able to identify with the archetype of a good student. simply put, if you in your mind do not think of yourself as a good student, then you are not a good student. our minds have an interesting way of creating self fulfilling prophecy, and to put it bluntly. if you say you can't do something, you're right. the first step towards becoming a good student is to tell yourself from this point on, you're a good student. thus, the journey to becoming good at school begins.

to begin, lets talk about effective studying grades are a product of the effectiveness of the study system. if you're studying for 12 hours a day and still getting only 70s and 80s, then it's time to assess your methods and figure out what's not working. some of the methods that really tend to work include:

- pomodoro: mainly a tool that helps you avoid burnout while maximizing the amount of effective study time.
- flashcards: great for memorizing
- practice questions: great for learning how to solve problems relating to content
- blurting: great for memorizing, and assessing what you know/need to memorize
- feynman technique: great for understanding content

each of these techniques are cool, and they work. i mentioned the idea of effective study time, which i believe is a more accurate metric of how much you're actually studying. take our example person from the beginning who studies 12 hours a day. they probably only actually spend time working for 8 of those hours due to distractions, and after hour 5 they begin to study at around 50% effectiveness due to fatigue. we can calculate their effective study time by doing the following calculation:

$$
effective{\space}study{\space}time={\sum}time_i{\times}effetiveness_i
$$

which for our example, basically translates to:

$$
effective{\space}study{\space}time=(5{\times}100{\%})+(3{\times}50{\%})
$$
$$
effective{\space}study{\space}time=6.5{\space}hours
$$

therefore, the effective time spent studying is 6.5 hours. this brings me to my next point, which is sleeping. 

sleep is an essential requirement for good physical and mental health. it's also an essential requirement for effective knowledge retention, which is essential for studying and learning in general. it is critical that you get (at the minimum) 7-9 hours of sleep. it seems counter-intuitive to suggest this, but an extra hour of sleep is generally speaking more useful than an extra hour of studying. consider our effective study time formula. we get the maximum value from studying as long as our effectiveness stays at 100%. we can minimize effectiveness loss from fatigue by using good timing techniques like pomodoro, but we will always, unavoidably lose effectiveness from both tiredness and both short and long term sleep deprivation. the solution? sleep. you can read [[zettelkasten/how to get good sleep\|how to get good sleep]] here and develop a good sleep schedule.

combining both a good study system and a good sleep schedule will allow you to maximize the effectiveness of your time, and improve the likelihood of desirable results.

time management generally tends to be a big problem with students. there's simply not enough time to comfortably finish all of your tasks without a proper structure. however, there is a way that we can confidently manage time.

the first thing you are going to want to do is start using a calendar. it's a pretty easy thing to set up, and can improve your ability to manage time by keeping track of tasks and events externally instead of in your head.

blocking out your sleep time, morning/evening routine, and classes, you should see all of your available time. from here you can block out times to study certain subjects.

it really helps if you have a consistent sleep schedule, as this will lower variability and increase usability of your calendar.

another interesting method i saw recently in a reddit post optimizes productivity and time allocation around mood, you can see the post [[zettelkasten/I stopped trying to manage my time â€” and became insanely productive. Here's how\|here]]. i would honestly recommend you use this if your life is too chaotic to efficiently manage tasks with a calendar. 

this method can also be good even if you use a calendar. if you start feeling unproductive, reallocate your time according to how you feel. this can make sure you are managing your time externally, while also taking into account how you feel internally.

finally, this is the big one. this is the part that you'll most likely be thinking about for a while. what is your "why"? why are you doing this? what is the point? you can chase grades all you want but if you don't have an actual motivating factor, then what's the point? 

find your passion, find your "why", find out why you want to get good grades, and use that to motivate yourself. use the person you want to be to influence the person you are. ask yourself: "is this what my ideal self would do?" 

have a growth mindset, and never tell yourself you're not good at anything. i hate when people say: "i'm just not good at math" because it's stupid. of course you're bad at math if you keep saying it. and if you just accept that you're bad at math, you aren't going to strive to be better at it, because well, you're just not good at math.

remember, it's not always about effort, it's about results and efficiency
