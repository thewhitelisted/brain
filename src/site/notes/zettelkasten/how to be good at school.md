# how to be good at school

the first notable fact is that being good at school is not a matter of marks. chasing marks is never good and often leads to an unfavorable result, whether that is not achieving desirable results or not following through on habitual goals. in order to get better marks, we have to achieve the goal of becoming a good student first. if we become good students, then the good marks will come eventually. 

but what makes a good student? in my eyes there are a few main factors that differentiate a good student from a bad student.

most of the people who i meet who struggle with achieving desirable marks tend to say the following. "i can't get good marks!! i study for like 12 hours a day and pull all-nighters but i still get 70s!!" there's a lot wrong with this, and i'll explain why. first and foremost, the person is probably overexaggerating the amount of time they spend studying. even if they do study for that long, they may not be studying in an effective manner. finally, the biggest red flag is the fact that they do not prioritize sleep. i'll talk about what i would recommend in order to optimize effective studying in this document.

time management is a big factor for success in school. having the ability to allocate time to tasks effectively makes the entire process of studying, learning, and creating much easier. this also translates to your life outside of school, and can allow you to make the most out of your day.

this is the most important part, and it can greatly influence the first two. you have to be able to identify with the archetype of a good student. simply put, if you in your mind do not think of yourself as a good student, then you are not a good student. our minds have an interesting way of creating self fulfilling prophecy, and to put it bluntly. if you say you can't do something, you're right. the first step towards becoming a good student is to tell yourself from this point on, you're a good student. thus, the journey to becoming good at school begins.

remember, it's not always about effort, it's about results and efficiency
