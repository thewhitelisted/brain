# 1 - no one's crazy
- people do some crazy things with money, but nobody is crazy
* people are raised differently, and learn different lessons
* everyone has their own unique experiences of how the world works
* your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what's happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works. 
* no amount of studying or open-mindedness can genuinely create the same fear and uncertainty of a depression
* in theory people should make investment decisions based on their goals and the characteristics of the investment options available to them at the time
* it's just what environment you were born in
* "what you're doing seems crazy but i kind of understand why you're doing it"
