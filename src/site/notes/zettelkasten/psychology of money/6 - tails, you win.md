# 6 - tails, you win

- the farthest ends of the distribution of outcomes-have tremendous influence in finance, where a small number of events can account for the majority of outcomes
- anything that is huge, profitable, famous, or influential is the result of a tail event-an underlying one-in-thousands or millions event
- tails drive everything
- most financial advice is about what you should do right now, and what stocks look like good buys today
	- most of the time today is not important
	- over the course of your lifetime as an investor the decisions that you make today or tomorrow or next week will not matter nearly as much as what you do during the small number of days
- "a good definition of an investing genius is the man who can do the average thing when all those around him are going crazy"
- it's normal for lots of things to go wrong, break, fail, and fall
	- if you're a good stock picker you'll be right maybe half the time
