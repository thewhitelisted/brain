# 2 - luck and risk
* luck and risk are siblings
* both the reality of every outcome in life. everything is guided by forces other than individual effort
* "nothing is as good or bad as it seems"
* luck and risk are so similar that you can't believe in one without equally respecting the other
* everything worth pursuing has less than 100% odds of succeeding, and risk is just what happens when you end up on the unfortunate side of that equation
* "the line between inspiringly bold and foolishly reckless can be a millimeter thick and only visible with hindsight"
* BE CAREFUL WHO YOU PRAISE AND ADMIRE
* BE CAREFUL WHO YOU LOOK DOWN UPON AND WISH TO AVOID BECOMING
* FOCUS LESS ON SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS AND CASE STUDIES AND MORE ON BROAD PATTERNS
