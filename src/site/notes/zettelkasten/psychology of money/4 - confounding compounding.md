# 4 - confounding compounding
- relatively small changes in conditions can greatly change somethings growth
- if something compounds - if a little growth serves as the fuel for future growth - a small starting base can lead to results so extraordinary they seem to defy logic
- all of Warren Buffett's financial success can be tied to the financial base he built in his pubescent years and the longevity he maintained in his geriatric years
- his skill is investing, but his secret is time
- what seem like small changes in growth assumptions can lead to ridiculous, impractical numbers
- when compounding isn't intuitive we often ignore its potential and focus on solving problems through other means
- the counter intuitiveness of compounding may be responsible for the majority of disappointing trades, bad strategies, and successful investing attempts
- good investing isn't necessarily about earning the highest returns, because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that can't be repeated
- good investing is about earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time
- the opposite of this leads to some tragic stories
