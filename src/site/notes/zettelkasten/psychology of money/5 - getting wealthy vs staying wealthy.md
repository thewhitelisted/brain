# 5 - getting wealthy vs staying wealthy
- there are a million ways to get wealthy
- there's only one way to stay wealthy: some combination of frugality and paranoia
- summarizing money success in a single word: "survival"
- getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there
- keeping money requires the opposite. it requires humility, and fear that what you've made can be taken away from you just as fast. it requires frugality and an acceptance that at least some of what you've made is attributable to luck, so past success can't be relied upon to repeat indefinitely
- it's the ability to stick around for a long time, without wiping out or being forced to give up
- two reasons why a survival mentality is so key with money
	- one: few gains are so great that they're worth wiping yourself out over
	- two: the counter-intuitive math of compounding
- compounding only works if you give an asset years and years to grow
- getting and keeping the growth requires surviving all the unpredictable ups and downs that everyone experiences over time.
- applying the survival mindset to the real world comes down to appreciating three things
	- 1. more than i want big returns, i want to be financially unbreakable. i actually think i'll get the biggest returns, because i'll be able to stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders
	- 2. planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan
	- 3. a barbelled personality-optimistic about the future, but paranoid about what will prevent you from getting to the future-is vital
