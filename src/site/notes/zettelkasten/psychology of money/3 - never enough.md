# 3 - never enough
* for a critical element of our society, including many of the wealthiest and most powerful among us, there seems to be no limit today on what enough entails
* "there is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don't have and don't need"
* THE HARDEST FINANCIAL SKILL IS GETTING THE GOALPOST TO STOP MOVING
* if expectations rise with results there is no logic in striving for more because you'll feel the same after putting in extra effort.
* life isn't any fun without a sense of enough
* SOCIAL COMPARISON IS THE PROBLEM
* the ceiling of social comparison is so high that virtually no one will ever hit it. battle that will never be won
* ENOUGH IS NOT TOO LITTLE
* the idea of having "enough" might look like conservatism, leaving opportunity and potential on the table
* "enough" is the opposite. an insatiable appetite for more will push you to the point of regret
* THERE ARE MANY THINGS NEVER WORTH RISKING, NO MATTER THE POTENTIAL GAIN
* don't get too attached to anything
* reputation is invaluable, freedom and independence are invaluable, family and friends are invaluable, being loved by those who you want to love you is invaluable, happiness is invaluable.
* the best shot of keeping those things is by knowing when it's time to stop taking risks
